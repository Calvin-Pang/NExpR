### Environment

You can install the required packages with this command:

```
pip install requirements.py
```

### Data

We used three public datasets and one in-house data in our experiments. The three public datasets are: [PROSTATEx](https://www.cancerimagingarchive.net/collection/prostatex/), [fastMRI](https://fastmri.med.nyu.edu/) and [MSD](http://medicaldecathlon.com/).
